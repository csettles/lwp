Assignment 2: Support for Lightweight Processes (LWP's)
CSC 453 (Operating Systems), Spring 2018
Caitlin Settles

"This assignment requires you to implement support for lightweight processes (threads) under linux
using the GNU C Compiler(gcc). A lightweight process is an independent thread of control—
sequence of executed instructions—executing in the same address space as other lightweight processes.
Here you will implement a non-preemptive user-level thread package."
